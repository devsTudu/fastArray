# fastArray
All operations on array, in a faster way and options of testing different modules with different random values. Extra features Graph representations. 

This will have all the general operations on array, but it will have more time efficient computation.
it will include the benifits of arranged arrays and also the facility to remove redudancy. Really simple application but it will have bit higher approach.


This will also can check or compare your code against other programs, or you can compare two different algorithms together. An intuitive interface and also try to plot the result graphically.

For now its all in the mind. I will with my support (neighbours and stranger) complete it very soon.
